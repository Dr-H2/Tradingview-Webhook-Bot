# Tradingview-Alpaca-Binance connection server

Hello algo traders! This is the code for a simple server that takes Tradingview Webhooks and send orders to either Alpaca or Binance for automation! If you are familiar with setting up Flask and cloud servers like AWS, you know what to do next.

But if you need hand-in-hand help to set things up, please feel free to set up a session with Dr. H or Doc Martin from https://www.reallifetrading.co.uk/team
